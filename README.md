# HydroSafe Project

# What's the problem?

# How can technology help?

## The Idea
We propose a ‘Hydrosafe’ project to solve the issue of microorganisms and dirt in water by identifying the specific contaminant and giving specific solutions to the problem identified. This may not eradicate the problem fully but it will help reduce consumption of unsafe water and hence reduce death rates too.


## General Objective
To develop an AI-based Application that will be used to detect impurities in water.


## Specific Objectives
1. Detecting harmful bacterias in water.
2. Determine contaminants in water.
3. Analyze the level of contaminants in water  based on exploratory methods.
4. To build a real world mobile-based application that predicts the level of bacteria and water contamination.
